# Python High-Level Blockchain Simulation

## Overview
This project is a high-level simulation of a blockchain implemented in Python. It serves as an illustration for research projects on blockchain architecture and security. The simulation provides insight into key blockchain components, such as blocks, transactions, cryptographic hashing, and proof-of-work mechanisms.

## Features
- Blockchain Structure: Implements a simple blockchain with linked blocks containing transactions
- Proof-of-Work: Simulates mining with basic proof-of-work consensus
- Cryptographic Security: Uses SHA-256 hashing to secure transactions and blocks
- Transaction Handling: Allows adding transactions and mining new blocks

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/votre-utilisateur/Simulation-Blockchain.git
